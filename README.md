### Information Flow Within Social Networks

This project is the Capstone project in the [Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented).
It investigates cascading behaviors (or information flow) within a social network.

> When people are connected by a network, it becomes possible for them to influence each other's behavior and decisions.
> There is a nearly limitless set of situations in which people are influenced by others:
> in the opinions they hold, the products they buy, the political positions they support, the activities they pursue,
> the technologies they use, and many other things.
> What we'd like to do here is to go beyond this observation and consider some of the reasons why such influence occurs.

The first part of this project will look at what the *network equilibrium* looks like when given certain starting conditions, and after a number of simulations.
The second part of the project investigates the maximal conditions under which a __complete cascade__ can occur in a given social network.
